# Project Summary

## Overview

This project analyzes social media engagement with climate change content to understand public sentiment and interaction patterns. Using machine learning techniques, we predict engagement levels based on post content and metadata.

## Key Components

1. **Data Analysis**: Exploratory data analysis of social media posts related to climate change
2. **Feature Engineering**: Text processing with TF-IDF and temporal feature extraction
3. **Machine Learning**: Regression models to predict engagement metrics
4. **Visualization**: Comprehensive reporting of findings and model performance

## Technical Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.8+
- **Data Processing**: pandas, numpy
- **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn
- **Visualization**: matplotlib, seaborn
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebooks

## Project Structure

The project follows a modular approach with separate notebooks for each phase of analysis:
- Data loading and exploration
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Final reporting and visualization

## Results

The project compares multiple regression models for predicting social media engagement:
- Linear Regression (baseline)
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting

Performance is measured using MAE, RMSE, and RÂ² metrics.

## Applications

This analysis can inform:
- Climate change communication strategies
- Social media engagement optimization
- Public sentiment analysis
- Policy decision making
